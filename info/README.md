This git tutorial is for Sedna to become the very best in HTML. Anybody who accesses this repo may see multiple mistakes. This is normal as it is a learning process.

The .git folder should never be deleted. Please don't kill it, ever. Period.

The html folder will consist of the basic html code that you will be doing in this tutorial.
The css folder will consist of the .css codes that you will be doing in this tutorial.
The scripts folder will consist of the .js or any additional files needed
The info folder consists of the MIT Licence, this README file as well as the version control. When there is an update, a revision number beside it. Occasionally I will add a task file inside this folder as well, so take note!

HTML is basically the standard markup language for webpages. It helps construct the page, but not give it life. Scripts and web services will help make the page look much more alive, but that will be when everything is done!
